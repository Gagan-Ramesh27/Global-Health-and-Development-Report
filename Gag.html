<h2>Examining Access to Clean Drinking Water</h2>
<p>First, we examine a map visualization that illustrates the proportion of the population that utilizes clean drinking water sources free from hazardous chemicals or feces. Greener tones indicate regions with higher access, while redder tones highlight areas in need of assistance.</p>
